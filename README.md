### Differential Equations
- `solve y^2 x = y'`
- `3 e^(2t) = y'(t) - 2y(t)`
- `t^4 y(t)^2 + 4 = t^2 y'(t) + 2t y(t)`
- `sin(2x) = y''+ y`

### Calculus
- `derivative of x^4 + 9x^3 + 7x - 3`
- `integrate cos(x)^2sin(x)`
- `limit of (x - 3) / (x^2 - 3 - 2x) as x approaches 3`
- `find the extrema of 3x^4 - 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 2`

### Proofs
##### trigonometric identity:
- `(cos(x) + sin(x))/(cos(x) - sin(x)) = (1 + tan(x))/(1 - tan(x))`
##### sum identity:
- `prove by induction, sum of j from 1 to n = n(n+1)/2 for n>0`
##### divisibility:
- `using induction, prove 9^n-1 is divisible by 4, assuming n>0`
##### inequality:
- `prove by induction, (3n)! > 3^n (n!)^3 for n>0`
